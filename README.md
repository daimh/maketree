# makent, print a tree of dependencies from GNU make

'makent' assembles the dependency tree from make's debugging information, and prints it. It runs 'make -nt' in dry-run mode, and all the parameters after 'makent --'.

## Installation
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/makent/master/makent
chmod +x makent
mv makent ~/bin/ # or any directory in PATH
```

## Try out

Each \*.mk file is an example, while the Makefile combines all the tests in one file. 
```
cd test
make -n # check out how to run each makent example
make # run them all
```

## Help
```
makent -h
```
